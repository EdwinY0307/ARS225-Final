# ARS225-Final

Project idea- I wanted to visualize a future where people live their lives in the virtual world and allows the world around them to turn to ruin. In our modern society it has become ever more common to consume social media to the point that the consumption of social media has effected people's social skills and inability to communicate with one another. and at the same time large companies continue to polute the planet and we are blind to do anything about it.

Process- for my process I created a video of a man living in a fantasy world with a companion, the video slowley reveals that the man is alone and the home he is living in is simular to the tenement homes in late 1880s America, cramped and overcrowded. I generated the images with the colab notebook with the exception of the image of the man (the notebook did not generate results that matched my vison) with Canva. I used audio of laughter from Free sounds.

Conceptual reflection- Throughout this project I changed my final idea multiple times. It was difficult for me to do a speculative piece because I have not really ever thought about it in an artistic way. I got inspiration for this project from personal experience. I recently went to a wedding and the younger guests I observed were mostly on their phones. And then the idea hit me, due to changes in parenting, children in this generation grew up with devices and that has affected their social abilities. I see this first hand with my younger brother and how he was brought up in contrast to me. Along with this issue I wanted to also tackle how such behaviours could be taken advantage of, so to further emphasize how this anti-social behaviour could be exploited by large companies who are able to pollute the world without backlash because the people are dependent on the products they make. Overall this project is uniquely thought provoking, and speculative art is something that I would be interested in pursuing in the future with the works I want to make.

Art references- Many of the references used were of a dystopian future setting, So films like Blade Runner(1982), games like Cyberpunk 2077(2020), and the Cyberpunk table top(1988) helped me map out the look I was aiming for.
